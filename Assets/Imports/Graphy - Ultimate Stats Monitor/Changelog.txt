-----------------------------
v1.0

- First major update!
- Removed some leftover raycast targets from the Graphy UI to avoid interfering with users UI.
- Added a Customization Scene that allows changing all the parameters in runtime to improve the user experience when testing new values.
- Added a feature to rescale the background overlay of the Advanced Data module to the text with the highest width.
- Made ALL parameters modifiable from code using the API.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes the Graphy Manager would fail trying to retrieve the Audio Module.
- Improved stabilty.


-----------------------------
v0.6

- Added a feature to choose if you want to apply a background overlay to Graphy, improving readability in cluttered scenes.
- Optimized the access to Shader parameters when updating them, improving performance.


-----------------------------
v0.5.1

- Added a feature to choose if you want to keep Graphy alive through scene changes. Careful, if you activate it but Graphy is the child of another object, the root GameObject will also survive scene changes.
- Fixed a bug where setting Graphy as a child of another object would break the graphs.
